# About Nigeria Food Data

In this 3rd project will be all about a food data where an individual (who understand's Nigeria food dish) can create a data on what type of dish and when it will be prepared. As you may know Nigeria is a country with several traditions, languages, and cultures. This means there will be several types of food dish from those distinctive cultures. For example with the Yoruba culture, one of the most common food dish is the Amala staple with the drawy Ewa soup. The Igbo culture has one of the most common food dish which is Oha/Okazi soup with the Eba staple. A popular soup very common in the Central South of Nigeria (dubbed the South-South Region) is the Edikaiko. There are many more common foods in Nigeria that can be explored such as Joloff Rice, Plaintain dish, Yam, Cassava, etc. The also reason also for this website is that the individual will table down the process of making the typical dish and when it will be ready.

# Website
Here is the <a href="https://donald-task-manager-project.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Website</a>

# UX
This website in summary is meant to make it easier for the individual to understand Nigerian cultural food and directions on how to prepare the dish using several types of recipe.
The Home Page is is a simple introduction with food slides of Nigerian food examples and simple statements. This is to provide an outlook as to what you understand in a Nigeria food and their recipes. Normally in a food website, there is just too much information about several foods as well as updates. But the website is a simple food data that is strictly meant for Nigeria traditional foods and their methodology in the food making. Also included is when they are meant to be made.

The sign in and sign up pages backgrounds are wooden and few fruit images. The forms are light in colour so as to give a clear text when typing alongside sign in font awesome icons.

While you are signed in, you can go to the new file page and fill in the details. When you submit it takes you to your account page. There you can make changes to one of the files on the account. 

## User stories
This website is useful because:
- Nigerian foods, according to African food specialists, are very complicated 
- They are compicated due to the right amount of spices needed to make the dishes
- With the complications, it is useful to keep a diary or record on when, how, and what food to make
- It is easy to sign up to create such food diary. 

## Mockups
This is a multi-page website. There are pages containing where to signup, signin, and the home page that are outside signing in. When the individual sign in into an existed account, then there will be additional pages such as account and signout. In the account page is where the individual will have a chance to view the saved food diary. Inclusive in this page is the choice to go on to view the Foodlist page where the individual has the option to remove or change a type of food. 
In addition there is the New File page where the individual is able to create and submit a new food diary. 

## Wireframing
This is the wireframe of the website.[Here it is](https://db3pap007files.storage.live.com/y4mZHHPNLiL6S-WPrwsVnfyFVeNnPfODkHwdULhLQyEta7G84vHnFSUgJXVorrWXrLcqAOD4HOTLOV3YMlFR1QkvcAiht9Oli658XcTFKB_nQz6E3nls02NCfpH78naaHO2KPlwmSp8utKfOSWvR-FzR3tMXcvFlg-e1WaoPiyNSIeWkLCGGg5Eph03_7JTgFxj?width=1129&height=1963&cropmode=none)

## Features
Most of the website pages have Nigerian food background images. The Sign Up and Sign in pages have form boxes where the invdividual can put in their respective details.
To view how these are made you can view this on Gitpod workspaces. These are the screenshots to be exactly sure:

# Technologies
- ### PYTHON: This is the main chief software language programme used to create the readability of the website. The main version used here the version Python 3.8.
- ### HTML5:  this is used to create the major content of the website
- ### CSS3: this is used to design the font style details
- ### JAVASCRIPT :
- *Javascript:* This is to provide the effective functions to the HMTL.
- *JQUERY:* Javascript technology used for DOM designs
- ### FLASK: It is an easy web application used by Python for complex applications. 
- ### JINJA: this is a Flask-Python-based language where the templates are evaluated using a sandbox. 
- ### MATERIALIZE: This is a library component used to give the constructed webpages the design effects. This is adhere to the modern principles such as mobile compartibility on browsers. The alternative to this is Bootstrap.
- ### WERKZEUG: this is a WSGI web application library. This is was used to develop hash password.
- ### MONGODB ATLAS: This is a cloud database that contains the user details. This is one of the most popular NoSQL database.
- ### PYMONGO: this tutorial program MongoDB stores document into the MongoDB database known as MongoDB Atlas. PyMongo in this case is imported from Flask_Pymongo as PyMongo is a package with MongoDB. 
- ### PIP3: This is used to install several of the technologies into Python3 such as PyMongo, Jinja, etc. The new version used in this case pip version 20.2.4. 
- ### OBJECTID: This is used by MongoDB to generate a default ID value in a specific document.

## Installation
- PIP3: The installation process begins using pip3 install. To execute the pip in the presently used Python version, python -m pip code was used. To view the version being installed, pip3 --version was entered displaying it as 'pip 20.2.4 from /workspace/.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)'
- Flask: This latest version was installed using  pip3 install flask.
- Werkzeug: The main requirement for this installation is a Python3 and more present. To install this, the code 'pip install -U Werkzeug' was used.


# Deployment of the project
The workspace is saved by using CTRL+S. To deploy the workspace temporary to a github, it can be done using:
- python3 -m http.server

## Final Deployment
For final Deployment:
- git add -A
- git status
- git commit -m "message"
- git push
## Using herokuapp
Instead of using the common Github to deploy the website herokuapp is needed to just that. This is because Github pages can't run python or flask servers.. This increases the site functions. This app is free and is not used for web production.
To use the app, you need to sign up to create a new account. Navigate through to the dashboard and pick the 'New' button. Then go to 'Create' new app. Give the app a new name. When it is time to deploy the website select the button at the right top. 
Moreover the website is deployed by linking the Github page to the herokuapp.

## Validation
- The CSS was tested using a CSS validation site known as https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- The Javascript was tested using a JS validation site known as http://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php . However on line 17, the 'instance' and 'M' were copied from Materialise and it is used in providong the collapse "effect" needed.

### Debugging issues
- When you Python debugging method on HTML codes there will be a development of errors. 
- Also using the Python Debugging method on this development is not intended for production deployment.

## Results from using Lighthouse
Lighthouse is easy and free to use instead of other validation tools such as Pigdom. 
The result of the website testing is [Here](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?psiurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdonald-task-manager-project.herokuapp.com%2F&strategy=mobile&category=performance&category=accessibility&category=best-practices&category=seo&category=pwa&utm_source=lh-chrome-ext). 

Note: to view this webpage you need to add Lighthouse to the browser extension.
Here is the screenshot of the workspace of Python and the rest.


## The functionality of the website
The website is tested to see that the forms were filled in successfully. The details of each forms where checked on the database of MongoDB to see if they exist.

## User stories
**- The user is able to log/sign up into the account and create the right Nigerian recipe.**
+ I am of an Igbo origin and I love Egusi soup. But I need to create a data where I can make the right recipe for the food.

**- The user cannot remember all the recipe formula for the food making so she made an account to list the recipe and describe the methodoly of making the food.**
+ I like to make Amala and Ewedu but they are too complicated and therefore I tend to forget how to make them. So this website is good in that I can list the date to make it and following the recorded description on how to make it. 

**- This is my mum who thought that the website is great for her as she will use it to preserve the recorded recipes she will need for making a typical complex soup.**
+ I have not been feeling well for the last few months and over the time I have forgotten how to make the exact special Ofe-Oha Igbo soup. This is because of the high speciality in it and due to its complexity to make it. Using this website is very good for me as I can follow the tabulation and recipe preparation steps in making it.
