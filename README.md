# About Nigeria Food Data

In this 3rd project will be all about a food data where an individual (who understand's Nigeria food dish) can create a data on what type of dish and when it will be prepared. As you may know Nigeria is a country with several traditions, languages, and cultures. This means there will be several types of food dish from those distinctive cultures. For example with the Yoruba culture, one of the most common food dish is the Amala staple with the drawy Ewa soup. The Igbo culture has one of the most common food dish which is Oha/Okazi soup with the Eba staple. A popular soup very common in the Central South of Nigeria (dubbed the South-South Region) is the Edikaiko. There are many more common foods in Nigeria that can be explored such as Joloff Rice, Plaintain dish, Yam, Cassava, etc. The also reason also for this website is that the individual will table down the process of making the typical dish and when it will be ready.

# Website
Here is the <a href="https://donald-task-manager-project.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Website</a>

# UX
This website in summary is meant to make it easier for the individual to understand Nigerian cultural food and directions on how to prepare the dish using several types of recipe.

## User stories
This website is useful because:
- Nigerian foods, according to African food specialists, are very complicated 
- They are compicated due to the right amount of spices needed to make the dishes
- With the complications, it is useful to keep a diary or record on when, how, and what food to make
- It is easy to sign up to create such food diary. 

## Mockups
This is a multi-page website. There are pages containing where to signup, signin, and the home page that are outside signing in. When the individual sign in into an existed account, then there will be additional pages such as account and signout. In the account page is where the individual will have a chance to view the saved food diary. Inclusive in this page is the choice to go on to view the Foodlist page where the individual has the option to remove or change a type of food. 
In addition there is the New File page where the individual is able to create and submit a new food diary. 

## Wireframing
This is the wireframe of the website.

## Features
Most of the website pages have Nigerian food background images. The Sign Up and Sign in pages have form boxes where the invdividual can put in their respective details.
To view how these are made you can view this on Gitpod workspaces. These are the screenshots to be exactly sure:

# Technologies
- ### HTML5:  this is used to create the major content of the website
- ### CSS3: this is used to design the font style details
- ### JAVASCRIPT :
- *Javascript:* This is to provide the effective functions to the HMTL.
- *JQUERY:* Javascript technology used for DOM designs
- ### Flask: It is an easy web application used by Python for complex applications. 
- ### Jinja: this is a Flask-Python-based language where the templates are evaluated using a sandbox.

# Deployment of the project
The workspace is saved by using CTRL+S. To deploy the workspace temporary to a github, it can be done using:
- python3 -m http.server

## Final Deployment
For final Deployment:
- git add -A
- git status
- git commit -m "message"
- git push

# Testing
Using DeVop technologies can be browsed using these platforms:
### Google Chrome DeVop
### Mozilla DeVop
### Mobile Dev tools
- All Samsung Galaxy series
- All iPhone series
- All iPhone series
### Mobile Browsing DeVop tools

## Validation
The website was tested using W3 CSS 
## Results from using Lighthouse
The result of the website testing is here. Note: to view this webpage you need to add Lighthouse to the browser extension.
Here is the screenshot of the workspace of Python and the rest.

## The functionality of the website
The website is tested to see that the forms were filled in successfully. The details of each forms where checked on the database of MongoDB to see if they exist.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
