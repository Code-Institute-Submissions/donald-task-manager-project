# About Nigeria Food Data

In this 3rd project will be all about a food data where an individual (who understand's Nigeria food dish) can create a data on what type of dish and when it will be prepared. As you may know Nigeria is a country with several traditions, languages, and cultures. This means there will be several types of food dish from those distinctive cultures. For example with the Yoruba culture, one of the most common food dish is the Amala staple with the drawy Ewa soup. The Igbo culture has one of the most common food dish which is Oha/Okazi soup with the Eba staple. A popular soup very common in the Central South of Nigeria (dubbed the South-South Region) is the Edikaiko. There are many more common foods in Nigeria that can be explored such as Joloff Rice, Plaintain dish, Yam, Cassava, etc. The also reason also for this website is that the individual will table down the process of making the typical dish and when it will be ready.

# Website
Here is the <a href="https://donald-task-manager-project.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Website</a>

# UX
This website in summary is meant to make it easier for the individual to understand Nigerian cultural food and directions on how to prepare the dish using several types of recipe.

## User stories


A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
